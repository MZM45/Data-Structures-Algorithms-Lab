There are five balls of different colors (Red, Green, Blue, Orange, and Yellow) in a jar. Players take the ball from jar for playing. Write a program that maintains the stack of balls and prints the following
a.	How many balls are left in a jar?
b.	Colour of ball taken by each player.
c.	“No ball available” if palyer6 arrives.

Code:
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

const int maxBalls = 5;
std::string jarOfBalls[maxBalls];
int top = -1;

bool isEmpty() {
    return top == -1;
}

bool isFull() {
    return top == maxBalls - 1;
}

void push(const std::string& color) {
    if (isFull()) {
        std::cout << "Player says: 'No ball available!'" << std::endl;
    }
    else {
        jarOfBalls[++top] = color;
    }
}

std::string pop() {
    if (isEmpty()) {
        return "";
    }
    else {
        return jarOfBalls[top--];
    }
}

int main() {
    std::string colors[] = { "Red", "Green", "Blue", "Orange", "Yellow" };

    std::cout << "Initial number of balls in the jar: " << maxBalls << std::endl;

    for (int player = 1; player <= 6; player++) {
        if (!isEmpty()) {
            std::string ballColor = pop();
            if (ballColor != "") {
                std::cout << "Player " << player << " takes a " << ballColor << " ball." << std::endl;
            }
            else {
                std::cout << "Player " << player << " says: 'No ball available!'" << std::endl;
            }
        }
        else {
            std::cout << "Player " << player << " says: 'No ball available!'" << std::endl;
        }
    }

    std::cout << "Remaining number of balls in the jar: " << maxBalls - top - 1 << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
