Consider the following array “Weight” that stores the weight of boxes in kilograms.
21.5	15.0	12.5	25.0	17.5	24.0	35.0	40.0	27.5	22.0
33.0	12.5	23.5	10.25	5.5	45.5	19.25	12.25	32.0	20.0



a.	Write a program that finds the heaviest weight and print its location.
b.	Write a program that finds the lightest weight and prints its location

Code:
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

const int ARRAY_SIZE = 20;

int main() {
    double weights[ARRAY_SIZE] = {
        21.5, 15.0, 12.5, 25.0, 17.5, 24.0, 35.0, 40.0, 27.5, 22.0,
        33.0, 12.5, 23.5, 10.25, 5.5, 45.5, 19.25, 12.25, 32.0, 20.0
    };

    double heaviestWeight = weights[0];
    double lightestWeight = weights[0];
    int heaviestLocation = 0;
    int lightestLocation = 0;

    for (int i = 1; i < ARRAY_SIZE; i++) {
        if (weights[i] > heaviestWeight) {
            heaviestWeight = weights[i];
            heaviestLocation = i;
        }
        if (weights[i] < lightestWeight) {
            lightestWeight = weights[i];
            lightestLocation = i;
        }
    }

    
    cout << "Heaviest Weight: " << heaviestWeight << " at location " << heaviestLocation << endl;
    cout << "Lightest Weight: " << lightestWeight << " at location " << lightestLocation << endl;

    return 0;
}
