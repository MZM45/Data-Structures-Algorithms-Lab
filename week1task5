Write a program that stores the birth year of 20 students in an array.
a.	Print the position of the youngest student.
b.	Print the number of students who are 20 years old.
Code:
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int birthYears[20] = {
        2003, 1999, 2002, 2001, 2000, 2005, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2001,
        2000, 1998, 2003, 2000, 2001, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2001, 2003
    };

    int youngestYear = birthYears[0];
    int youngestPosition = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < 20; i++) {
        if (birthYears[i] > youngestYear) {
            youngestYear = birthYears[i];
            youngestPosition = i;
        }
    }

    cout << "a. Position of the youngest student: " << youngestPosition << endl;

    
    int students20YearsOld = 0;
    int currentYear = 2023; 

    for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
        if (currentYear - birthYears[i] == 20) {
            students20YearsOld++;
        }
    }

    cout << "b. Number of students who are 20 years old: " << students20YearsOld << endl;

    return 0;
}
