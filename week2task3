Consider an array that stores the square of 1-25 numbers in unsorted order. Write a program that takes input from user a number and display the location of squared number that stores in an array.
For example	
Input: 5
Output: Location of 25 is 6th index
Code:
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

const int ARRAY_SIZE = 25;

int main() {
    int squares[ARRAY_SIZE] = {
        1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100,
        121, 144, 169, 196, 225, 256, 289, 324, 361, 400,
        441, 484, 529, 576, 625
    };

    int numberToFind;

    // Input the number to search for its square
    cout << "Enter a number to find its square: ";
    cin >> numberToFind;

    // Perform a linear search to find the location of the square
    int location = -1;
    for (int i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE; i++) {
        if (squares[i] == numberToFind) {
            location = i;
            break; // Exit the loop when found
        }
    }

    // Check if the square was found and display the location
    if (location != -1) {
        cout << "Location of " << numberToFind << " is at index " << location << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Square of " << numberToFind << " not found in the array" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
